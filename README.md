# Web app developed for XenonStack Technical Task

## Tech used: MERN + PicoCSS + JWT auth + Vercel for deploying

### This web app supports login/logout, contact us functionality in addition to other pages that involve database interaction (MongoDB).

### To create a new student, we need to manually hit the createuser auth endpoint, as it would not make sense to allow a random person to register as student in a college.

## IMPORTANT --> Sample credentials for login -> email: t@op.com & password: t2100

### Deployed on Vercel.
